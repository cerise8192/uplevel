The code is in:
https://github.com/cerise8192/uplevel

The executable is changes.py

You can set "owner", "repo", and "token" as environment variables to provide
the owner, repository, and PAT that you wish to use.  If they are not present, then you will be prompted for them.

All three scenarios are implemented in an intentionally naive fashion.

This code is not to be used for any reason other than evaluation that I know
how to use python for the purpose of this opportunity.  It is not released
under any open license.
